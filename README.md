An R package for digital media analytics.

This is my first attempt at building an R package.  

Many of my ideas are influenced by the usual suspects - Hadley Wickham, Winston Chang, etc - with a twist a digital media optimization twist.

Please reach out at maloneypatr@gmail.com if you have any questions or suggestions.

Thanks!
